Projects for Computer Organization II, taught by Gary Tyson at Florida State University. My favorite CS class as of 5/22/13.

The rubric is in the folder, but the project consisted of three parts:
 * Assembler for the language specification of LC3101. Turn MIPS-like code into machine code that the LC3101 can understand
 * Simulator of LC3101 as a multicycle processor.
 * Implementation of a multipler.

Rubric is in the folder, a pipelined implementation of LC3101. The assembler from proj1 was used.
